# python manage.py collectstatic
# This feature is very handy for serving static files, 
# especially in production settings.
# Imagine we wanted to deploy our website right away. 
# Among other steps, weâ€™d need to run collectstatic to 
# create a single, production-ready directory 
# of all the static files in our project.
